     *
     * Because PUT is an overwrite operation, you must include all the fields that you want set after the operation completes. Typically, you’ll send a GET request, update the fields you want to change, and pass that object in the PUT request.
     *
     * You may set either `overall_level` or the individual settings like `aggression`, but not both.
     *
     * Setting `overall_level` applies default values to the individual settings. However, setting `overall_level` to 4 does not necessarily mean that it applies 4 to all the individual settings. Instead, it applies a set of recommended defaults to the rest of the settings. For example, if you set `overall_level` to 2, Twitch provides some filtering on discrimination and sexual content, but more filtering on hostility (see the first example response).
     *
     * If `overall_level` is currently set and you update `swearing` to 3, `overall_level` will be set to **null** and all settings other than `swearing` will be set to 0\. The same is true if individual settings are set and you update `overall_level` to 3 — all the individual settings are updated to reflect the default level.
     *
     * Note that if you set all the individual settings to values that match what `overall_level` would have set them to, Twitch changes AutoMod to use the default AutoMod level instead of using the individual settings.
     *
     * Valid values for all levels are from 0 (no filtering) through 4 (most aggressive filtering). These levels affect how aggressively AutoMod holds back messages for moderators to review before they appear in chat or are denied (not shown).

For example, if you call the API at the 4:00 minute mark, the API captures from approximately the 3:35 mark to approximately the 4:05 minute mark. Twitch tries its best to capture 90 seconds of the stream, but the actual length may be less. This may occur if you begin capturing the clip near the beginning or end of the stream.

To specify the title and the portion of the 90 seconds window that’s used for the clip, use the URL in the response’s `edit_url` field. You can specify a clip that’s from 5 seconds to 60 seconds in length. The URL is valid for up to 24 hours or until the clip is published, whichever comes first.

If Get Clips returns the clip, the clip was successfully created. If after 15 seconds Get Clips hasn’t returned the clip, assume it failed.

   *
   * Because PUT is an overwrite operation, you must include all the fields that you want set after the operation completes. Typically, you’ll send a GET request, update the fields you want to change, and pass that object in the PUT request.
   *
   * You may set either `overall_level` or the individual settings like `aggression`, but not both.
   *
   * Setting `overall_level` applies default values to the individual settings. However, setting `overall_level` to 4 does not necessarily mean that it applies 4 to all the individual settings. Instead, it applies a set of recommended defaults to the rest of the settings. For example, if you set `overall_level` to 2, Twitch provides some filtering on discrimination and sexual content, but more filtering on hostility (see the first example response).
   *
   * If `overall_level` is currently set and you update `swearing` to 3, `overall_level` will be set to **null** and all settings other than `swearing` will be set to 0\. The same is true if individual settings are set and you update `overall_level` to 3 — all the individual settings are updated to reflect the default level.
   *
   * Note that if you set all the individual settings to values that match what `overall_level` would have set them to, Twitch changes AutoMod to use the default AutoMod level instead of using the individual settings.
   *
   * Valid values for all levels are from 0 (no filtering) through 4 (most aggressive filtering). These levels affect how aggressively AutoMod holds back messages for moderators to review before they appear in chat or are denied (not shown).
